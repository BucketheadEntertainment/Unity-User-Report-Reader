# Unity-User-Report-Reader
A Windows Form application that reads Unity User Report JSON files.

## Where can I find those JSON files?
The JSON files can be downloaded from the [Unity Gaming Services](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/) site. Make sure you're registered to that website, so we can access it.

Then follow the steps written by Unity: https://unitytech.github.io/clouddiagnostics/userreporting/UnityCloudDiagnosticsUserReports.html



Good luck and hope it's useful to you!
